# Updating Data

Use the `UPDATE` command, along with the keyword `SET`.

Each column can be updated separately without affecting the others.

You should specify which condition a row must meet in order to be updated, otherwise all rows will be updated.

```sql
UPDATE products SET price = 55.50 WHERE price = 99.99;
UPDATE products SET price = 1.16 * price;  -- add 16% VAT perhaps
```

You can update more than one column by listing more than one assignment in the `SET` clause:

```sql
UPDATE products SET name = 'bag of apples', price = 100 WHERE product_no = 1001;
