# Constraints

Constraints enable you to control the data stored in table columns. If data to be entered violates a constraint, an error is raised (even if the value is a default).

**Column constraints** follow a column definition's data type, and apply to it alone.

**Table constraints** are written separately from column definitions. Column constraints can be written as table conatraints.

To specify a named constraint, use the key word `CONSTRAINT`, followed by an identifier, followed by the constraint definition. Otherwise, the system chooses one for you.

## 1. Check Constraints

Allow you to specify that the values in a column *must satisfy a Boolean* expression. Consist of the `CHECK` key word, and an expression in `()`.

Satisfied if the check expression evaluates to `true` or the `null` value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    name    text,
    price   numeric CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Nothing much', 0);
ERROR:  new row for relation "products" violates check constraint "products_price_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (Nothing much, 0).
```

You can name the check constraint to easily reference it and to clarify error messages.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    name    text,
    price   numeric CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Nothing much', 0);
ERROR:  new row for relation "products" violates check constraint "positive_price"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (Nothing much, 0).
```

A check constraint can refer to multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    name                text,
    price               numeric CHECK (price > 0),
    discounted_price    numeric,
    CHECK (discounted_price > 0 AND price > discounted_price)
);
```

>**NOTE:** *PostgreSQL* assumes that `CHECK` constraints' conditions are *immutable*. In case of changes, drop the constraint (using `ALTER TABLE`) and then re-add it to re-check it against all rows.

## 2. Not-Null Constraints

Specify that a column must not assume the `null` value.

Always written as column constraints.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    name    text NOT NULL,
    price   numeric NOT NULL CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO products VALUES ('nothin');
ERROR:  null value in column "price" of relation "products" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (nothin, null).
```

## 3. Unique Constraints

Ensure that the data contained in a column (or group of columns) is unique among all rows in the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no      integer UNIQUE,  -- as column constraint
    name            text,
    price           numeric,
    transaction_id  integer,
    UNIQUE (transaction_id)  -- as table constraint
);
```

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO products (product_no, transaction_id) VALUES (1, 2), (1, 2);
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "products_product_no_key"
DETAIL:  Key (product_no)=(1) already exists.
```

To define a unique constraint for a group of columns, write it as a table constraint, with the column names separated by commas.

Adding a unique constraint will automatically create a unique *B-tree index* on the column or group of columns listed in the constraint.

>**NOTE:** Since null values are never considered equal, it is possible to store duplicate rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained columns.

## 4. Primary Keys

Indicate that a column (or group of columns) can be used as a *unique identifier* for rows in the table - *unique* and *not null*.

A table can have at most one primary key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    transaction_id  integer,
    product_id      integer,
    price           numeric NOT NULL CHECK (price > 0),
    PRIMARY KEY (transaction_id, product_id)
);
```

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3);
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "sales_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (transaction_id, product_id)=(1, 2) already exists.
```

Adding a primary key will automatically create a unique *B-tree index* on the column or group of columns listed in the primary key, and will force the column(s) to be marked `NOT NULL`.

The primary key defines the default target column(s) for foreign keys referencing the table.

## 5. Foreign Keys

Specify that the values in a column (or group of columns) must match the values appearing in some row of another table.

Maintain *referential integrity* between two related tables.

A table can have more than one foreign key constraint, to implement *many-to-many* relationships between tables.

A foreign key must reference columns that are either a primary key or form a unique constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no  integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name        text,
    price       numeric
);
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id    integer PRIMARY KEY,
    product_no  integer REFERENCES products (product_no),
    quantity    integer
);
```

This ensures that the orders table only contains orders of products that exist.

```sql
mydb=> INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price) VALUES (1, 'thingy', 2);
INSERT 0 1
mydb=> INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_no, quantity) VALUES (1, 1, 2), (2, 3, 1);
ERROR:  insert or update on table "orders" violates foreign key constraint "orders_product_no_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (product_no)=(3) is not present in table "products".
```

The orders table is the *referencing* table, and the products table is the *referenced* table.

In the absence of a column list in a foreign key declaration, the primary key of the referenced table is used as the referenced column(s).

A foreign key can also constrain and reference a group of columns when written in table constraint form.

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
  a integer PRIMARY KEY,
  b integer NOT NULL,
  c integer NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (b, c) REFERENCES other_table (col1, col2)
);
```

The “other table” of a foreign key constraint can be the same table - a *self-referential* foreign key i.e if you want rows of a table to represent nodes of a tree structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tree (
    node_id     integer PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id   integer REFERENCES tree,
    name        text,
);
```

To create a many-to-many relationship:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    product_no  integer REFERENCES products,
    order_id    integer REFERENCES orders,
    quantity    integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id)
);
```

This allows an order to contain possibly many products.

In case a product is removed after orders referencing it have been created, you can:

- **Disallow deleting** using `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
- **Delete** the orders **as well** using `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Take `NO ACTION` (default). An error is raised.
- **Set the default** value for referencing row(s)' column(s)  using `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`.
- **Set the null** value to referencing row(s)' column(s) using `ON DELETE SET NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    product_no  integer REFERENCES products ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    order_id    integer REFERENCES orders ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity    integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id)
);
```

`ON UPDATE`, which is invoked when a referenced column is changed, is treated analogously to `ON DELETE`.

If `MATCH FULL` is included in the foreign key declaration, a row with a mix of null and non-null values will fail to satifsy the constraint, but a row of all nulls will escape (unless NOT NULL is also specified).

Declaration of a foreign key constraint does not automatically create an index on the referencing columns, but it is advisable to do so to speed up deletes and updates.

## 6. Exclusion Constraints

Ensure that if any two rows are compared on the specified columns or expressions using the specified operators, at least one of these operator comparisons will return `false` or `null`.

Adding an exclusion constraint will automatically create an index of the type specified in the constraint declaration.

```sql
CREATE TABLE circles (
    c circle,
    EXCLUDE USING gist (c WITH &&)  -- no overlapping cirlces
);
```
