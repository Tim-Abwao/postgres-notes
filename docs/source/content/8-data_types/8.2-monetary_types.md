`money` stores currency amounts with a *fixed fractional precision*.

The `lc_monetary` setting determines the locale to use for formatting monetary amounts.

Input for `money` is accepted in a variety of numeric formats, including typical currency formatting such as '$25'. Output depends on locale.

```psql
mydb=> SET lc_monetary='sw_KE.utf8';
SET
mydb=> SELECT '25000'::money;
    money     
--------------
 Ksh25,000.00
(1 row)
```

>**NOTE:** Since the output is *locale-sensitive*, it might not work to load `money` data into a database that has a *different setting* of `lc_monetary`.
>
>Before restoring a dump into a new database, make sure `lc_monetary` has the *same or equivalent value* as in the database that was dumped.

`numeric`, `int` and `bigint` types can be directly cast to `money`, but `real` and `double precision` have to be cast to `numeric` first.

A `money` value can be cast to `numeric` without loss of precision. Conversion to other types involves intermediate conversion to `numeric`, and could potentially lose precision.

Division of a `money` value with an `int` involves *truncation* of the fractional part towards zero. To avoid losing precision, cast the value to `numeric` before dividing and back to `money` afterwards.

When a `money` value is divided by another `money` value, the result is `double pecision` and not `money`. The currency units cancel each other.
