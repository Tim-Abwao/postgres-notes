# Deleting Data

Use the `DELETE` command.

You'll need to specify a condition that rows to be removed must match, or else all rows will be deleted.

```psql
mydb=> DELETE FROM farm_products WHERE name = 'unknown';
DELETE 2
mydb=> SELECT * FROM farm_products;
   name   | price | units_in_stock 
----------+-------+----------------
 Carrots  |  1.74 |             64
 Garlic   |  2.32 |             40
 Apples   | 29.00 |            100
 Bananas  | 11.60 |             32
 Cherries |  3.48 |             74
(5 rows)

mydb=> DELETE FROM farm_products;  -- deletes all rows
DELETE 5
mydb=> SELECT * FROM farm_products;
 name | price | units_in_stock 
------+-------+----------------
(0 rows)   
```
