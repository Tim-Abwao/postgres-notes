# LIMIT & OFFSET

```md
SELECT select_list
    FROM table_expression
    [ ORDER BY ... ]
    [ LIMIT { number | ALL } ] [ OFFSET number ]
```

`LIMIT` specifies the number of rows to return, unless the query yields less rows.

`LIMIT ALL` and `LIMIT NULL` are equivalent to omitting the LIMIT clause.

`OFFSET` specifies how many rows to skip before returning rows.

`OFFSET 0` and `OFFSET NULL` are equivalent to omitting the OFFSET clause.

When using `LIMIT`, it is essential to use an `ORDER BY` clause, or else you'll get an unpredictable subset of rows.

```psql
sales=> SELECT *
sales->   FROM products
sales->   ORDER BY id
sales->   LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
 id | price 
----+-------
  6 | 27.55
  7 | 14.90
  8 | 26.75
(3 rows)
```

>**NOTE:** The *query optimizer* takes `LIMIT` into account when generating query plans.
>
>A large `OFFSET` *may be inefficient* since the rows skipped still have to be computed inside the server.
