# LIMIT & OFFSET

SELECT select_list

    [ ORDER BY ... ]
    [ LIMIT { number | ALL } ] [ OFFSET number ]
```

`LIMIT` specifies that no more than *number* rows should be returned (can be less). `LIMIT ALL` and `LIMIT NULL` are equivalent to omitting the LIMIT clause.

```{important}
When using `LIMIT`, it is essential to use an `ORDER BY` clause, or else you'll get unpredictable subsets of rows.
```

```psql
mydb=> SELECT * FROM drinks ORDER BY unit_price LIMIT 3;
   name   | unit_price | serving_temp 
----------+------------+--------------
 Lemonade |      $5.50 | cool
 Milk     |      $7.50 | cool
 Tea      |      $9.50 | warm
(3 rows)
```

```psql
mydb=> SELECT * FROM drinks ORDER BY unit_price LIMIT 10;  -- drinks has only 5 rows
   name   | unit_price | serving_temp 
----------+------------+--------------
 Lemonade |      $5.50 | cool
 Milk     |      $7.50 | cool
 Tea      |      $9.50 | warm
 Tea      |      $9.99 | hot
 Coffee   |            | hot
(5 rows)
```

`OFFSET` specifies how many rows to skip before returning rows. `OFFSET 0` and `OFFSET NULL` are equivalent to omitting the OFFSET clause.

```psql
mydb=> SELECT * FROM drinks ORDER BY unit_price LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
 name | unit_price | serving_temp 
------+------------+--------------
 Tea  |      $9.50 | warm
 Tea  |      $9.99 | hot
(2 rows)
```

```{note}
The *query optimizer* takes `LIMIT` into account when generating query plans.

A large `OFFSET` *may be inefficient* since the rows skipped still have to be computed inside the server.
```
