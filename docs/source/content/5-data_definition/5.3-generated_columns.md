# Generated Columns

A generated column is computed from other columns. There are 2 kinds:

1. **Stored Generated Columns:**

    - Computed when they are *inserted / updated*.
    - Occupy storage like normal columns.

2. **Virtual Generated Columns:**
    - Computed when they are *read*.
    - Occupy no storage.
    - Not yet implemented in *postgres*.

To create a generated column, use the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` clause in `CREATE TABLE`. The keyword `STORED` must be specified to choose the stored kind of generated column:

```psql
mydb=> CREATE TABLE roadtrip (
mydb(>   start_location   text,
mydb(>   start_time       timestamp,
mydb(>   end_location     text,
mydb(>   end_time         timestamp,
mydb(>   duration         interval GENERATED ALWAYS AS (end_time - start_time) STORED
mydb(> );
CREATE TABLE
```

```psql
mydb=> INSERT INTO roadtrip (start_location, start_time, end_location, end_time)
mydb->   VALUES ('Malindi', '2023-08-01 09:12', 'Changamwe', '2023-08-01 10:55');
INSERT 0 1
```

A generated column can't be written to directly. But the keyword `DEFAULT` may be specified in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` commands:

```psql
mydb=> INSERT INTO roadtrip (start_location, start_time, end_location, end_time, duration)
mydb->   VALUES ('Nairobi', '2023-08-04 06:04', 'Naivasha', '2023 08-04 07:19', '1:15:00');
ERROR:  cannot insert a non-DEFAULT value into column "duration"
DETAIL:  Column "duration" is a generated column.
```

```psql
mydb=> INSERT INTO roadtrip (start_location, start_time, end_location, end_time, duration)
  VALUES ('Nairobi', '2023-08-04 06:04', 'Naivasha', '2023 08-04 07:19', DEFAULT);
INSERT 0 1
mydb=> SELECT * FROM roadtrip;
 start_location |     start_time      | end_location |      end_time       | duration 
----------------+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------
 Malindi        | 2023-08-01 09:12:00 | Changamwe    | 2023-08-01 10:55:00 | 01:43:00
 Nairobi        | 2023-08-04 06:04:00 | Naivasha     | 2023-08-04 07:19:00 | 01:15:00
(2 rows)
```

| Column default                              | Generated column                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Evaluated once, on insert                   | Updated whenever the row changes  |
| May not refer to other columns              | Usually refers to other columns   |
| Can use volatile functions e.g. `random()`  | Cannot use volatile functions     |

## Rules

- The generation expression can only use *immutable functions*, and cannot use subqueries or reference anything other than the current row.
- A generation expression cannot reference another generated column.
- A generation expression cannot reference a system column, except `tableoid`.
- A generated column cannot have a column default or identity definition.
- A generated column cannot be part of a partition key.
- Foreign tables can have generated columns (`CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`).
- For inheritance:

  - If a parent column is a generated column, a child column must also be a generated column using the same expression. In the definition of the child column, leave off the GENERATED clause, as it will be copied from the parent.

  - In case of multiple inheritance, if one parent column is a generated column, then all parent columns must be generated columns and with the same expression.

  - If a parent column is not a generated column, a child column may be defined to be a generated column or not.

Generated columns *maintain access privileges separately* from their underlying base columns. You can arrange for a particular role to only read from a generated column but not from the underlying base columns.

Generated columns are updated after `BEFORE` triggers have run. Changes made to base columns in a `BEFORE` trigger will be reflected in generated columns. However, it is not allowed to access generated columns in `BEFORE` triggers.
