# Privileges

When an object is created, it is assigned an owner (usually the role that executed the creation statement).

You can assign ownership to another role if you are:

- a superuser or
- the current owner (or member of the owning role) **and** a member of the new owning role.

{.no-copybutton}

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO new_owner;
```

Initially, only the owner or superusers can work with an object, unless privileges are granted. We use the `GRANT` command to assign privileges:

{.no-copybutton}

```sql
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE (details) ON staff_info TO hr_assistant;
```

Applicable privileges depend on the object's type. Writing `ALL` instead of a specific privilege grants all privileges relevant to the object type.

The special role `PUBLIC` can be used to grant a privilege to *every role* on the system. You can set up "group" roles to help manage privileges.

Use the `REVOKE` command to revoke previously granted privileges:

{.no-copybutton}

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE (details) ON staff_info FROM hr_assistant;
```

```{note}
Ordinarily, only the object's owner (or a superuser) can grant or revoke privileges on an object. But if a privilege is granted **"with grant option"**, the recipient is allowed to grant it in turn to others.

If the grant option is revoked, all who received the privilege from that recipient (directly or through a chain of grants) will lose the privilege.

Owners are always treated as holding all grant options, and so can revoke and re-grant their own privileges.
```

- `SELECT`
  - Allows `SELECT` on all (or specific) columns of a table, view, materialized view or other table-like object.
  - Allows `COPY TO`.
  - Required to reference existing column values in `UPDATE`, `DELETE` or `MERGE`.
  - Allows `currval` function in sequences.
  - Allows large objects to be read.

- `INSERT`
  - Allows `INSERT` of new rows to all / specified columns.
  - Allows `COPY FROM`.

- `UPDATE`
  - Allows `UPDATE` on any / specified columns.
  - Typically requires the `SELECT` privilege to determine rows to update.
  - Required in `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`.
  - Allows `nextval` and `setval` functions in sequences.
  - Allows writing and truncating large objects.

- `DELETE`
  - Allows `DELETE` on rows from a table, view, ...
  - Typically requires `SELECT` privilege - to reference table columns and determine what rows to delete.

- `TRUNCATE`
  - Allows `TRUNCATE` on a table.

- `REFERENCES`
  - Allows creation of a foreign key constraint.

- `TRIGGER`
  - Allows creation of a trigger on a table, view, ...

- `CREATE`
  - In databases:
    - allows creation of schemas and publications
    - allows installation of trusted extensions.
  - In schemas:
    - allows creation of new objects
    - allows renaming of existing objects you own.
  - In tablespaces:
    - allows creation of tables, indexes and temporary files
    - allows creation of databases with the tablespace as default.

  ```{note}
  Revoking this privilege will not alter the existence or location of existing objects.
  ```

- `CONNECT`
  - Allows connection to the database.
  - Checked at connection startup.

- `TEMPORARY`
  - Allows creation of temporary tables.

- `EXECUTE`
  - Allows calling a function / procedure, including use of any operators implemented on top of the function.

- `USAGE`
  - For procedural languages:
    - allows use of the languages to create functions.
  - For schemas:
    - allows access to contained objects, assuming the objects' privilege requrements are met.

      ```{caution}
      One can view object names even without this privilege e.g. by querying system catalogs.
      
      Revoking this permission is not a secure way to prevent object access since existing sessions might have statements that have previously performed the "look up".
      ```

  - For sequences:
    - allows use of `currval` and `nextval` functions.
  - For types and domains:
    - allows use in creation of tables, functions and other schema objects.
  - For foreign-data wrappers:
    - allows creation of new servers.
  - For foreign servers:
    - allows creation of foreign tables
    - allows creation, alteration or dropping of user mappings associated with the server.

- `SET`
  - Allows setting a server configuration parameter within the current session.

- `ALTER SYSTEM`
  - Allows setting a server configuration parameter using the `ALTER SYSTEM` command.

*PostgreSQL* grants default privileges when objects are created. These can be overridden using the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` command.

Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner, and can include some privileges for `PUBLIC` depending on the object type.
