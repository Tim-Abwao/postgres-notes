# Privileges

When an object is created, it is assigned to the role that executed the creation statement.

Initially, only the owner or superusers can work with the object, unless privileges are granted.

Use the `GRANT` command to assign privileges:

```sql
GRANT privilege ON object TO new_role;
```

You must be both the current owner (or member of the owning role) and a member of the new owning role; or a superuser, for this to work.

Writing `ALL` instead of a specific privilege grants all privileges relevant to the object type.

The special role `PUBLIC` can be used to grant a privilege to *every role* on the system.

Use the `REVOKE` command to revoke previously granted privileges:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON accounts FROM PUBLIC;
```

Use an appropriate `ALTER` command to assign ownership:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO new_owner;
```

You can grant a privilege *"with grant option"* to allow the recipient the right to grant it in turn to others.

If the grant option is revoked, all who received the privilege from that recipient (directly or through a chain of grants) will lose the privilege.

Owners are always treated as holding all grant options, and so can revoke and re-grant their own privileges.

- `SELECT`
  - Allows `SELECT` on any / specified columns of a table, view, materialized view or other table-like object.
  - Also allows `COPY TO`.
  - Required to reference existing column values in `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.
  - Allows `currval` function in sequences.
  - Allows large objects to be read.

- `INSERT`
  - Allows `INSERT` of new rows to all / specified columns.
  - Allows `COPY FROM`.

- `UPDATE`
  - Allows `UPDATE` on any / specified columns.
  - Typically requires the `SELECT` privilege to determine rows to update.
  - Required in `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT .. FOR SHARE`.
  - Allows `nextval` and `setval` functions in sequences.
  - Allows writing and truncating large objects.

- `DELETE`
  - Allows `DELETE` of rows from a table, view, ...
  - Typically requires `SELECT` privilege - to reference table columns and determine what rows to delete.

- `TRUNCATE`
  - Allows `TRUNCATE` on a table.

- `REFERENCES`
  - Allows creation of a foreign key constraint

- `TRIGGER`
  - Allows creation of a trigger on a table, view, ...

- `CREATE`
  - In databases:
    - allows creation of schemas and publications
    - allows installation of trusted extensions.
  - In schemas:
    - allows creation of new objects
    - allows renaming of objects.
  - In tablespaces:
    - allows creation of tables, indexes and temporary files
    - allows creation of databases with the tablespace as default.

  >**NOTE:** Revoking this privilege will not alter the existence or location of existing objects.

- `CONNECT`
  - Allows connection to the database.
  - Checked at connection startup.

- `TEMPORARY`
  - Allows creation of temporary tables.

- `EXECUTE`
  - Allows calling a function  / procedure, including use of any operators implemented on top of the function.

- `USAGE`
  - For procedural languages:
    - allows use of the languages to create functions.
  - For schemas:
    - allows access to contained objects.

      >**NOTE**: One can view object names even without this privilege e.g. by querying system catalogs.
      >
      > Revoking this permission is not a secure way to prevent object access since existing sessions might have statements that have previously performed the "look up".
  - For sequences:
    - allows use of `currval` and `nextval` functions.
  - For types and domains:
    - allows use in creation of tables, functions and other schema objects.
  - For foreign-data wrappers:
    - allows creation of new servers.
  - For foreign servers:
    - allows creation of foreign tables
    - allows creation, alteration or dropping of user mappings associated with the server.

*PostgreSQL* grants default privileges when objects are created. These can be overridden using the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` command.

Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner, and can include some privileges for `PUBLIC` depending on the object type.

Assigned privileges are displayed as a list of `aclitem` entries. A `*` appears only when grant options have been explicitly granted.
