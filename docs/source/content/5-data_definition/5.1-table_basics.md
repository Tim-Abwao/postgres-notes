# Table Basics

Tables consist of columns and rows.

## Columns

The *number* and *order* of columns is *fixed*.

Each column has a *data type* which constrains the set of possible values assignable to it, and assigns semantics for computations.

Depending on column type, a table can have around 250 - 1600 columns.

## Rows

The *number* of rows reflects the amount of stored data, and *order* is *not guaranteed*.

A table can have several identical rows.

## Creating Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    name      text,
    price     numeric
);
```

## Deleting Tables

```sql
DROP TABLE products;
```
