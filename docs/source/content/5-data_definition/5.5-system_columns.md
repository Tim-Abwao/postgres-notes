# System Columns

Every table has several system columns that are implicitly defined by the system:

- **tableoid:** The OID of the table containing this row.

  - Handy for queries that select from *partitioned tables* or *inheritance heirachies* (tells which particular table a row came from)
  - Can be joined with the `oid` column of `pg_class` to obtain the table name.

- **xmin:** The identity (transaction ID) of the inserting transaction for this row version.
- **cmin:** The command identifier (starting at zero) within the inserting transaction.
- **xmax:** The identity (transaction id) of the deleting transaction, or zero for an undeleted row version. If non-zero in a visible row version, this signifies an uncommitted or rolled-back deleting transaction.
- **cmax:** The command identifier within the deleting transaction, or zero.
- **ctid:** The physical location of the row within its table. Changes if a row is updated or moved by `VACUUM FULL`.

```psql
mydb=> CREATE TABLE alphabet (letter char(1));
CREATE TABLE
mydb=> INSERT INTO alphabet VALUES ('a'), ('b');
INSERT 0 2
mydb=> INSERT INTO alphabet VALUES ('c'), ('d');
INSERT 0 2
mydb=> SELECT letter, tableoid, xmin, cmin, xmax, cmax, ctid FROM alphabet;
 letter | tableoid | xmin | cmin | xmax | cmax | ctid  
--------+----------+------+------+------+------+-------
 a      |    17026 | 1038 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,1)
 b      |    17026 | 1038 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,2)
 c      |    17026 | 1039 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,3)
 d      |    17026 | 1039 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,4)
(4 rows)
```

*Transaction IDs* are 32-bit quantities. Uniqueness is not guaranteed for over a billion transactions.

*Command identifiers* are also 32-bit quantities, limiting each transaction to 2^32 (4,294,967,296) SQL commands. Only commands that actually modify the database contents will consume a command identifier.
