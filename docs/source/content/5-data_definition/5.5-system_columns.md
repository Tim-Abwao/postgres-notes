# System Columns

These are implicitly defined by the system. Their names cannot be used as names of user-defined columns.

- **tableoid:** The OID of the table containing this row.

    Handy for queries that select from *partitioned tables* or *inheritance heirachies*.

    Can be joined with the `oid` column of `pg_class` to obtain the table name.

- **xmin:** The identity (transaction ID) of the inserting transaction for this row version.

    A row version is an individual state of a row. Each update of a row creates a new row version for the same logical row.

- **cmin:** The command identifier (starting at zero) within the inserting transaction.
- **xmax:** The identity (transaction id) of the deleting transaction, or zero for an undeleted row version.

    If non-zero in a visible row version, this signifies an uncommitted or rolled-back deleting transaction.

- **cmax:** The command identifier within the deleting transaction, or zero.
- **ctid:** The physical location of the row within its table.

    Changes if a row is updated or moved by `VACUUM FULL`.

*Transaction IDs* are 32-bit quantities. Uniqueness is not guaranteed for over a billion transactions.

*Command identifiers* are also 32-bit quantities, limiting each transaction to 2^32 (4,294,967,296) SQL commands. Only commands that actually modify the database contents will consume a command identifier.
