# Schemas

A database contains one or more schemas, which in turn contain tables, data types, functions, operators and other named objects.

This allows the use of the same object name in different schemas without conflict.

A client connection to the *postgres* server can only access a single database, specified in the connection request. But users can access objects in any of the schemas in the database, if granted privileges.

Use cases:

- To have multiple users in a database, without interference.
- To organise database objects into logical groups
- To avoid name collisions e.g. from 3rd-party apps

Schemas are analogues to directories in file-systems, but can't be nested.

The default schema is named `public`, and created objects are added to it if no schema is specified.

```md
CREATE TABLE some_table ( ... );
-- is equivalent to (default)
CREATE TABLE public.some_table ( ... );
```

>**NOTE:** There is no concept of a `public` schema in the SQL standard. For maximum conformance to the standard, you should not use the `public` schema.

## Creating a Schema

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA some_schema;
```

The schema name can't start with `pg_` (system reserved).

To create or access objects in a specific schema, write a a *qualified name* e.g. `schema.object_name`, `database.schema.object_name`.

```psql
mydb=> CREATE TABLE some_schema.some_table (id SERIAL, value INT); 
CREATE TABLE
```

You'll often want to create a schema owned by someone else - one way to restrict user activities to well-defined namespaces:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA some_schema AUTHORIZATION some_user;
```

Omiting the schema name sets it same as the user name.

If you wish to use qualified operator names in expressions, use the synatax:

```sql
OPERATOR(schema.operator)
-- e.g. SELECT 3 OPERATOR(pg_catalog.+) 4;
```

## Deleting a Schema

```sql
DROP SCHEMA some_schema;  -- if it's empty
DROP SCHEMA some_schema CASCADE;  -- drop also all contained objects
```

## The Schema Search Path

Tables are often referred to by unqualified names for convenience. The system determines which table is meant by following a `search_path` - a list of schemas to look in. Then the first matching table is taken. An error is raised if no match is found, even if the table exists in some other schema.

```psql
mydb=> SHOW search_path;
   search_path   
-----------------
 "$user", public
(1 row)
```

The 1st schema in `search_path` is called the *current schema*. `$user` refers to the schema with the current user's name. If it doesn't exist, it's ignored.

The 1st schema that exists is the default location for creating new objects.

Adding a schema to `search_path` effectively trusts all users having `CREATE` privileges on that schema. Thus, a user can accidentally or maliciously create objects that tamper with your queries.

You can add a schema to the path with:

```sql
SET search_path TO some_schema,pulic;
```

Using:

```sql
SET search_path TO some_schema;
```

means you'd have to use qualified names for objects in the public schema.

## Priveleges

Users can't access any objects in schemas they don't own (default). The owner must grant them the `USAGE` privilege.

The `CREATE` privilege is needed to create new objects.

By default, all users have `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on the schema `public`. This can be revoked with:

```sql
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

## Usage Patterns

A *secure schema usage pattern* prevents untrusted users from meddling with others' queries.

Options include:

- Constrain ordinary users to user-private schemas.
  - `REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC`.
  - Create a separate schema for each user, with the user's name so it's first in `search_path`.
  - Secure unless untrusted user is the database owner or holds the `CREATEROLE` privilege.
- Remove `public` schema from the default search path.
  - Modify `postgresql.conf` or use `ALTER ROLE ALL SET search_path = $user`.
  - Now users must use qualified names to access/create objects in `public`.
  - Calls to functions in `public` are still unsafe.
  - Also secure unless untrusted user is the database owner or holds the `CREATEROLE` privilege.

In any case, to install shared applications (tables for everyone, additional functions from 3rd-parties, ...), put them in separate schemas, and grant appropriate privileges.

A quick hack to secure your queries would be to set `search_path` to `''`, or otherwise remove schemas other non-superusers can write to.
