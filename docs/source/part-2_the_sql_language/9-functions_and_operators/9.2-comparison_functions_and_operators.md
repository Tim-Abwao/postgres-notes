# Comparison Functions & Operators

## 1. Comparison Operators

| Operator                       | Description              |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| datatype < datatype → boolean  | Less than                |
| datatype > datatype → boolean  | Greater than             |
| datatype <= datatype → boolean | Less than or equal to    |
| datatype >= datatype → boolean | Greater than or equal to |
| datatype = datatype → boolean  | Equal                    |
| datatype <> datatype → boolean | Not equal                |
| datatype != datatype → boolean | Not equal                |

>**NOTE:** `<>` is the SQL notation for *not equal*. `!=` is an alias, converted to `<>` at a very early stage of parsing.

Comparison operators are available for all built-in data types that have a *natural ordering* (numeric, string, date/time, ...).

Arrays, composite types and ranges can be compared if their component data types are comparable.

It's possible to compare values of *related data types* e.g. `interger` < `bigint`, by either:

- *cross-type* comparison operators, if available
- coercing the less general type to the more general during parsing

All comparison operators are *binary operators* that return `boolean` values, so expressions like `1 < 2 < 3` are *not valid*. Use `BETWEEN` to perform range tests.

## 2. Comparison Predicates

| Predicate                                                         | Description                                               | Example(s)                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| datatype BETWEEN datatype AND datatype → boolean                  | Between (inclusive of the range endpoints).               | 2 BETWEEN 1 AND 3 → t     <br>    2 BETWEEN 3 AND 1 → f                                                             |
| datatype NOT BETWEEN datatype AND datatype → boolean              | Not between (the negation of BETWEEN).                    | 2 NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 3 → f                                                                                           |
| datatype BETWEEN SYMMETRIC datatype AND datatype → boolean        | Between, after sorting the two endpoint values.           | 2 BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 3 AND 1 → t                                                                                     |
| datatype NOT BETWEEN SYMMETRIC datatype AND datatype → boolean    | Not between, after sorting the two endpoint values.       | 2 NOT BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 3 AND 1 → f                                                                                 |
| datatype IS DISTINCT FROM datatype → boolean                      | Not equal, treating null as a comparable value.           | 1 IS DISTINCT FROM NULL → t    <br>   (rather than NULL)  NULL IS DISTINCT FROM NULL → f (rather than NULL)         |
| datatype IS NOT DISTINCT FROM datatype → boolean                  | Equal, treating null as a comparable value.               | 1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NULL → f   <br>    (rather than NULL)  NULL IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NULL → t (rather than NULL) |
| datatype IS NULL → boolean                                        | Test whether value is null.                               | 1.5 IS NULL → f                                                                                                     |
| datatype IS NOT NULL → boolean                                    | Test whether value is not null.                           | 'null' IS NOT NULL → t                                                                                              |
| datatype ISNULL → boolean                                         | Test whether value is null (nonstandard syntax).          |                                                                                                                     |
| datatype NOTNULL → boolean                                        | Test whether value is not null (nonstandard syntax).      |                                                                                                                     |
| boolean IS TRUE → boolean                                         | Test whether boolean expression yields true.              | true IS TRUE → t  <br>     NULL::boolean IS TRUE → f (rather than NULL)                                             |
| boolean IS NOT TRUE → boolean                                     | Test whether boolean expression yields false or unknown.  | true IS NOT TRUE → f    <br>     NULL::boolean IS NOT TRUE → t (rather than NULL)                                   |
| boolean IS FALSE → boolean                                        | Test whether boolean expression yields false.             | true IS FALSE → f     <br>    NULL::boolean IS FALSE → f (rather than NULL)                                         |

`BETWEEN` simplifies range tests. Endpoint values are treated as included.

```sql
a BETWEEN x AND y
a >= x AND a <= y
```

`BETWEEN SYMMETRIC` automatically swaps endpoint values if that to the left of `AND` is >= that to the right, so that a non-empty range is always implied.

```psql
mydb=> SELECT 3 BETWEEN 7 AND 2;
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)

mydb=> SELECT 3 BETWEEN SYMMETRIC 7 AND 2;
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
```

>**NOTE:** The use of `AND` in `BETWEEN` syntax creates ambiguity with the use of `AND` as a logical operator, so only a limited set of expressions are allowed as the second argument of a `BETWEEN` clause.

> To write complex sub-expressions in `BETWEEN`, use `()`.

Ordinary comparison operators yield `null` ("unknown") when either input is null e.g. `7 = NULL` and `7 <> NULL` both yield `null`.

For non-null inputs, `IS DISTINCT FROM` is the same as `<>`. But if both inputs are null it returns false, and if only one input is null it returns true.

`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` is similar to `=` for non-null inputs, but it returns true when both inputs are null, and false when only one input is null.

Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to check whether a value is null or not.

`ISNULL` and `NOTNULL` work too but are not standard.

If the *expression* is row-valued, `IS NULL` is true when the row expression itself is null or if all its fields are null; whereas `IS NOT NULL` is true when the row expression itself is non-null and all its fields are non-null.

Thus `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` don't always return inverse results for row-valued expressions. A row-valued expression with both null and non-null fields returns false for both tests.

`row IS DISTINCT FROM NULL` and `row IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NULL` simply check the overal row value, with no additional checks on row fields.

Boolean values can be tested using predicates:

```sql
boolean_expression IS TRUE
boolean_expression IS NOT TRUE
boolean_expression IS FALSE
boolean_expression IS NOT FALSE
boolean_expression IS UNKNOWN
boolean_expression IS NOT UNKNOWN
```

These return true or false, never null.

Null input is treated as the logical value "unknown", so `IS UNKNOWN` and `IS NOT UNKNOWN` are effectively the same as `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` when the input expression is boolean.

## 3. Comparison Functions

| Function                                      | Description                                   | Example(s)                    |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| num_nonnulls ( VARIADIC "any" ) → integer     | Returns the number of non-null arguments.     | num_nonnulls(1, NULL, 2) → 2  |
| num_nulls ( VARIADIC "any" ) → integer        | Returns the number of null arguments.         | num_nulls(1, NULL, 2) → 1     |
