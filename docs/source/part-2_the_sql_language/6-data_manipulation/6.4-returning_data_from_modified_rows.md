# Returning Data from Modified Rows

`INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands have an optional `RETURNING` clause to obtain data from modified rows while they're being manipulated.

Especially useful when it would be difficult to identify the modified rows reliably.

`RETURNING` clause contents are similar to a `SELECT` clause's (column names, value expressions, ...).

- From an `INSERT`:
  - returns the row(s) as inserted
  - handy when relying on computed default values e.g. `SERIAL`:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id            serial primary key,
      first_name    text,
      last_name     text
  );
  ```

  ```psql
  mydb=> INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Ethan', 'Hunt') RETURNING id;
   id 
  ----
   1
  (1 row)

  INSERT 0 1
  ```

- From an `UPDATE`:
  - returns the new contents of the modified row(s)

  ```psql
  mydb=> UPDATE products SET price = price * 0.95
  mydb->   WHERE price > 99
  mydb->   RETURNING name, price AS discounted_price;
       name      | discounted_price 
  ---------------+------------------
   bag of apples |            95.00
  (1 row)

  UPDATE 1
  ```

- From a `DELETE`:
  - returns the contents of the deleted row(s)

  ```psql
  mydb=> DELETE FROM products
  mydb->   WHERE name = 'mangoes'
  mydb->   RETURNING *;
   product_no |  name   | price 
  ------------+---------+-------
         1007 | mangoes | 64.38
  (1 row)

  DELETE 1
  ```

>**NOTE:** If there are *triggers* on the target table, the data available to `RETURNING` is the row as modified by the triggers. Thus, inspecting columns computed by triggers is another common use-case for `RETURNING`.
