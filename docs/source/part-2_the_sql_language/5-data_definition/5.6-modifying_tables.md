# Modifying tables

## 1. Adding a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN description text CHECK (description <> '');
```

The new column is initially filled with null or whatever value is given in the `DEFAULT` clause.

## 2. Removing a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN description;
```

The column's data and constraints disappear.

If the column is referenced by a foreign key constraint in another table, an error is raised unless you add a `CASCADE` clause.

## 3. Adding a Constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD CHECK (name <> '');
ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT unique_name UNIQUE (name);
```

Use the table constraint syntax.

To add a not-null constraint, which cannot be written as a table constraint, use:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN product_no SET NOT NULL;
```

The constraint will be checked immediately, so the table data must satisfy it before it can be added.

## 4. Removing a Constraint

You'll need to know the constraint's name. The psql command `\d tablename` can help.

```psql
mydb=> \d products
                Table "public.products"
   Column    |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
-------------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 product_no  | integer |           | not null | 
 name        | text    |           |          | 
 price       | numeric |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "products_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (product_no)
    "unique_name" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (name)
Check constraints:
    "products_name_check" CHECK (name <> ''::text)
Referenced by:
    TABLE "order_items" CONSTRAINT "order_items_product_no_fkey" FOREIGN K
EY (product_no) REFERENCES products(product_no) ON DELETE RESTRICT
    TABLE "orders" CONSTRAINT "orders_product_no_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (produc
t_no) REFERENCES products(product_no)
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE products DROP CONSTRAINT products_name_check;
```

Add `CASCADE` to drop a constraint that something else depends on.

To drop a `NOT NULL` constraint, use:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price DROP NOT NULL;
```

(Not-null constraints don't have names)

## 5. Changing a Column's Default Value

To set a new default value for a column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 99.99;
```

This won't affect existing rows; only future `INSERT` commands.

To remove a default value, use:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price DROP DEFAULT;
```

Equivalent to setting the default to null.

## 6. Changing a Column's Data Type

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price TYPE numeric(10, 2);
```

Only works if all existing entries in the column can be converted to the new type.

For more complex conversions, add a `USING` clause to specify how to compute new values from the old.

*PostgreSQL* will attempt to convert default values and constraints as well, but it's often better to drop them first, and add suitably modified ones afterwards.

## 7. Renaming a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE products RENAME COLUMN product_no TO product_number;
```

## 8. Renaming a Table

```sql
ALTER TABLE products RENAME TO items;
```
