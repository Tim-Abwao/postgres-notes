# ORDER BY

Specifies the sort order:

```md
SELECT select_list
    FROM table_expression
    ORDER BY sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS { FIRST | LAST }]
             [, sort_expression2 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS { FIRST | LAST }] ...]
```

`ASC` order is default. It puts smaller values first using the `<` operator.

`DESC` is determined using the `>` operator.

Ordering options are considered independently for each sort colums: `ORDER BY col1, col2 DESC`.

The sort expression(s) can be any expression that would be valid in the query's select list:

```sql
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table ORDER BY col1 + col2, col5;
```

By default, null values sort as if larger than any non-null value. So `NULLS FIRST` is default in `DESC`; and `NULLS LAST` is default in `ASC`.

When more than one sort expression is specified, later values sort rows that are equal according to earlier values.

A sort expression can also be the *column label* or *number* of an output column:

```sql
sales=> SELECT id, price FROM products ORDER BY price LIMIT 3;
 id  | price 
-----+-------
  44 |  5.80
 626 |  5.84
 181 |  6.64
(3 rows)

sales=> SELECT id, price FROM products ORDER BY 2 LIMIT 3;
 id  | price 
-----+-------
  44 |  5.80
 626 |  5.84
 181 |  6.64
(3 rows)
```

>**NOTE:** An output column name has to stand alone:
> `SELECT x + y AS sum, z FROM table ORDER BY sum + z;` is incorrect.
>
>This is meant to reduce ambiguity.
