# UNION, INTERSECT & EXCEPT

The results of 2 queries can be combined using the **set operations** *union*, *intersection*, and *difference*:

```md
query1 UNION [ALL] query2
query1 INTERSECT [ALL] query2
query1 EXCEPT [ALL] query2
```

The queries must be **"union compatible"** - returning the same number of columns, with corresponding columns having compatible data types.

- `UNION`
  - Effectively *appends* the result of query2 to the result of query 1, though order of rows is not guaranteed.
  - *Eliminates duplicate rows*, similar to `DISTINCT`, unless `UNION ALL` is used.

- `INTERSECT`
  - Returns rows *present in both* query1 and query2 results.
  - *Eliminates duplicate rows*, unless `INTERSECT ALL` is used.

- `EXCEPT`
  - Returns rows present in the result of query1 but not that of query2.
  - *Eliminates duplicates*, unless `EXCEPT ALL` is used.

Set operations can be combined:

```sql
query1 UNION query2 EXCEPT query3
-- is equivalent to
(query1 UNION query2) EXCEPT query3
```

You can use `()` to control evaluation order.

`UNION` and `EXCEPT` associate left-to-right, but `INTERSECT` binds more tightly than these 2:

```sql
query1 UNION query2 INTERSECT query3
-- is equivalent to
query1 UNION (query2 INTERSECT query3)
```
